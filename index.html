  <h1>
    Welcome to my school</h1>.<h3>Education is an essential part of our lives. We are nothing without knowledge, and education is what separates us from others. The main step to acquiring education is enrolling oneself in a school. School serves as the first learning place for most of the people. Similarly, it is the first spark in receiving an education. In this essay on my school, I will tell you why I love my school and what my school has taught me.

    We have all been to school and we have loved each and every moment we have spent over there as those were the building blocks of our lives. A school is a place where students are taught the fundamentals of life, as well as how to grow and survive in life. It instils in us values and principles that serve as the foundation for a child’s development.
    
    My school is my second home where I spend most of my time. Above all, it gives me a platform to do better in life and also builds my personality. I feel blessed to study in one of the most prestigious and esteemed schools in the city. In addition, my school has a lot of assets which makes me feel fortunate to be a part of it. Let us look at the essay on my school written below.

  <p class="text-muted" >This is our school Library.it was mage in 1390.
    The types of books we can have access to in school libraries are
     fiction books, non-fiction books, reference books, literature books,
      biographies, General Knowledge books, Fables and folktales, cookbooks
       and craft books, poetry books,
     books in a series, and wordless books.Importance of School Library
     It provides us with quality fiction and nonfiction books that encourage us to read more for pleasure and enrich our intellectual, artistic, cultural, social and emotional growth. The ambiance of the school library is perfect for learning without getting disturbed.
     
     This makes it easy for us to learn and grasp faster. It provides teachers the access to professional development, relevant information and reference material to plan and implement effective learning programs.
     
     Thus. School library is helpful to every member of the school community whether its students, teachers or any other staff member. It helps gain skills and knowledge for personal development.
     
     School library has a positive impact on the academic performance of the students. It helps us develop the overall skills necessary to succeed in the modern-day digital and social environment. It is important to develop the habit of visiting the library regularly.
     
     Role of a School Librarian
     Librarian has an important role to play in the effective functioning of the school library. Librarian has the essential skills to guide and support the library users learning, and help them develop into independent readers and learners. School librarian mainly performs the role of a teacher, information specialist, instructional partner, and program administrator.
     
     Librarians are not merely the caretakers of books anymore they are the consultants, information providers, instructional readers, curriculum designers, and teachers. They can help students in achieving their goals.
     
     The setup of the libraries has also changed into more like classroom setup. The role of the school librarian is to empower others with resources, information, skills, and knowledge and establish flexible learning and teaching environment.
     
     School librarian is like teaching staff and has a vital role to play in supporting literacy and impact students’ learning in a positive way. School librarian supports the learning of the students and helps them develop into efficient independent learners and readers.
     
     Library and Education are Interrelated
     Education and library are interrelated and fundamentally co-exist with each other. Education is the process of gaining knowledge, values, skills, habits, and beliefs. It is the social process in which children are subjected to the influence of the school environment to attain social competence personnel development.
     
     Education is the outcome of the knowledge and experience acquired. Library, on the other hand, is the source and storehouse of knowledge, information, and resources vital for the leap in the advancement of knowledge. Libraries enhance the cause of education and research.
     
     A library plays an important role in meeting the growing needs of people in literacy. The library is essential for self-education, a means of information and knowledge. Education is the complex social process of gaining knowledge and experience formally. In involves a system used for the development of the students. Library provides spiritual, inspirational, informative and interesting reading experience.
     
     Conclusion
     The library facilitates each student with access to essential resources and learning material for a smooth learning process. It plays a vital role in a student’s life. The design, modern tools, and strategies of the school libraries change with the changing times. The library is thus a leap in the advancement of the literacy provided in classrooms. Education and library cannot exist alone and are inseparable. The library is an essential part of the educational system.

    <p>The Power of Speech & Debate Education
      Debate is a valuable activity for students of all skill levels.
        Debate teaches useful skills for other academic pursuits and life more generally.
           Most obviously, debaters build confidence speaking in public and expressing
            their ideas eloquently.  That comfort speaking in front of others is useful in so many
             areas of life, from interviews to school presentations to discussions in college seminars.
      But the benefits of debating are not limited to the skills built while students are speaking—the
       preparation for competition teaches critical thinking and research skills, as well.  As F.
        Scott Fitzgerald once said, “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold
         two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.” 
          Debate tests and builds that ability by forcing students to see both sides of issues.  Debaters 
          flex their analytical muscles, learning to find the weak points in opponent’s arguments.  They
           learn to explain their own ideas and assess different viewpoints, whether in a debate round, a political
            discussion, a classroom, or a written essay.  And debate requires students to research their ideas and 
            support them with evidence, teaching them to conduct
             research and assess sources.  According to Arne Duncan, then-Secretary of 
             Education,
              debate is “uniquely suited” to build skills required of a modern citizen, including critical thinking,
               communication, collaboration, and creativity. Those skills help students express their thoughts 
               better in their academic work and their college applications
                (not to mention around your dinner table!).   The College Board recently
                 revamped the SAT test to focus more on exactly the sorts of skills debate 
                 teaches.  As the New York Times explained, students taking the new version of the test
                  must write “a critical response to a specific 
                  argument” based on analysis rather than personal experience. 
                   Debaters are used to responding to unfamiliar arguments in time-sensitive
                    situations; thinking critically about a written passage on the SAT is
                     not so different from responding to an opponent’s argument in a 
                     debate round.  Debaters likewise outscore non-debaters on every 
                     section of the ACT.  Studies across the country have found that
                     high school debate improves reading ability, grades, school attendance, 
                     self-esteem, and interest in school.  Duffin, Frank, Latitudes
                      in Learning, “Debate Across the Curriculum Results” (2005).  Many
                       universities even offer scholarships specifically for college debaters.
For those who commit to speech and debate, it offers a lifetime of benefits.  Forbes published an 
article titled “How to Find the Millennials Who Will Lead Your Company,” suggesting that the
 leaders of the future are ex-debaters.  As that article notes, debate teaches “how to persuade,
  how to present clearly, and how to connect with an audience,” exactly the skills businesses
   look for in their young employees.  You’ll find ex-debaters in every area of public life, 
   from Bruce Springsteen to Oprah Winfrey to Nelson Mandela.  60% of Congressional representatives
    participated in debate, as well as at least a third of the Supreme Court.  There are ex-debaters
     excelling in business, law, politics, academia, and many other fields.Perhaps most important of all
     , debate is fun!  You may have to cajole your son or daughter to go to their test prep class or 
     do their homework, but debate makes learning a game; students build their critical thinking and speaking
     skills without it ever feeling like work.   Debate gives students a rare opportunity to take 
     ownership over their own intellectual development.  And throughout the years of practice
      and competition, debate builds lifelong friendships and community, teaching teamwork
       as well. </p>

It has a small window through which the canteen incharge supplies us snacks, tea and cold drink. Our principal has allowed a stall of ice cream in the canteen. There are two other counters for books, stationery and beverages. It is mostly the parents who visit the stationery counter. The students go there only under compulsion. Their most favourite spot is the ice cream corner. The students flock round it and buy the ice creams that are available in different flavours.
 Their mouths water at the sight of ice cream and they want to break the queue to have it first. The second favourite counter is that of beverages. They wash down their lunches with some cold drink or a cup of tea. They sip it slowly so that it could last for the whole period. As the bottle starts showing its bottom, their speed also decreases. They glup down the last drop with a heavy heart as if it was the end of their friendship with the bottle.</p>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">School attendance matters. It is arguably one of the most important indicators of school success. You cannot learn what you are not there to learn. Students who attend school regularly improve their chances of being academically successful. There are obvious exceptions to both sides of the rule. There are a few students deemed academically successful who also have attendance issues and a few students who struggle academically who are always present. However, in most cases, strong attendance correlates with academic success, and poor attendance correlates with academic struggles.
    To understand the importance of attendance and the influence the lack thereof has, we must first define what constitutes both satisfactory and poor attendance.  Attendance Works, a non-profit dedicated to improving school attendance, has categorized school attendance into three distinct categories. Students who have 9 or fewer absences are satisfactory. Those with 10-17 absences are exhibiting warning signs for potential attendance issues.  Students with 18 or more absences have a clear cut chronic attendance issue. These numbers are based on the traditional 180-day school calendar.
    Teachers and administrators will agree that the students who need to be at school the most are the ones that are seemingly seldom there. Poor attendance creates significant learning gaps. Even if students complete the make-up work, they most likely will not learn and retain the information as well as if they had been there.
    Make-up work can pile up very quickly. When students return from an extended hiatus, they not only have to complete the make-up work, but they also have to contend with their regular classroom assignments. Students often make the decision to rush through or completely ignore the make-up work so that they can keep pace with their regular class studies.  Doing this naturally creates a learning gap and causes the student’s grades to drop. Over time, this learning gap increases to the point where it becomes nearly impossible to close.
    Chronic absenteeism will lead to frustration for the student. The more they miss, the more difficult it becomes to catch up. Eventually, the student gives up altogether putting them on a path towards being a high school dropout. Chronic absenteeism is a key indicator that a student will drop out. This makes it even more critical to find early intervention strategies to prevent attendance from ever becoming an issue.
    The amount of schooling missed can quickly add up. Students who enter school at kindergarten and miss an average of 10 days per year until they graduate high school will miss 140 days. According to the definition above, this student would not have an attendance problem. However, all together that student would miss nearly an entire year of school when you add everything together. Now compare that student with another student who has a chronic attendance issue and misses an average of 25 days a year. The student with a chronic attendance issue has 350 missed days or almost two entire years. It is no wonder that those who have attendance issues are almost always further behind academically than their peers who have satisfactory attendance.
    Strategies to Improve School Attendance
    Improving school attendance can prove to be a difficult endeavor.  Schools often have very little direct control in this area. Most of the responsibility falls on the student’s parents or guardians, especially the elementary aged ones.  Many parents simply do not understand how important attendance is. They do not realize how quickly missing even a day a week can add up. Furthermore, they do not understand the unspoken message that they are relaying to their children by allowing them to miss school regularly.  Finally, they do not understand that they are not only setting their children up to fail in school, but also in life.
    For these reasons, it is essential that elementary schools in particular focus on educating parents on the value of attendance.  Unfortunately, most schools operate under the assumption that all parents already understand how important attendance is, but that those whose children have a chronic attendance issue are simply ignoring it or do not value education. The truth is that most parents want what is best for their children, but have not learned or been taught what that is. Schools must invest a significant amount of their resources to educate their local community adequately on the importance of attendance.
    Regular attendance should play a part in the daily anthem of a school and a critical role in defining the culture of a school. The fact is that every school has an attendance policy. In most cases, that policy is only punitive in nature meaning that it simply provides parents with an ultimatum that essentially says “get your child to school or else.”  Those policies, while effective for a few, will not deter many for whom it has become easier to skip school than it is to attend. For those, you have to show them and prove to them that attending school on a regular basis will help lead to a brighter future.
    Schools should be challenged to develop attendance policies and programs that are more preventive in nature than they are punitive. This begins with getting to the root of the attendance issues on an individualized level. School officials must be willing to sit down with parents and listen to their reasons for why their children are absent without being judgmental. This allows the school to form a partnership with the parent wherein they can develop an individualized plan for improving attendance, a support system for follow through, and a connection to outside resources if necessary.
    This approach will not be easy. It will take a lot of time and resources. However, it is an investment that we should be willing to make based on how important we know attendance to be.  Our goal should be to get every child to school so that the effective teachers we have in place can do their jobs. When that happens, the quality of our school systems will improve significantly.</p>
